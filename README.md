Included:
- Backend development for user authentication, update management, and media handling.
- Networking setup for real-time updates.
- Data storage and retrieval for updates.

Excluded:
- Frontend GUI development (to be addressed later).
- Advanced analytics or data processing features.
- Integration with other social media platforms.

 Section 3 - System Architecture

 3.1 Overview
The system architecture consists of a backend server responsible for managing user authentication, update handling, and media storage. It includes real-time networking components to push updates to users' widgets.

 3.2 Architectural Diagrams
1. Component Diagram: Backend server, database, media storage, real-time communication service.
2. Sequence Diagram: User posting an update, server processing, and pushing the update.
3. Data Flow Diagram (DFD): Flow of data from user input to storage and dissemination.
